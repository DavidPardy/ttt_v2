Tic-Tac-Toe Built Using the Ruby Programming Language
========
What is Necessary to Play:
--------
- You will need Ruby installed. For Mac Users, I highly recommend [Ruby Version Manager](https://rvm.io/)Ruby Version Manager

Open up your terminal and type in 'git clone https://github.com/DavidPardy/ttt_v2.git'

- Once that process has taken place, type in 'cd ttt_v2', then 'cd lib'.

- To run the game, type in 'ruby start_game.rb'. This should bring up the board and ask for human input.

- The game is currently set up as human versus computer. The human is represented by an 'X' on the board, while the computer is shown as a 'O' on the board.
