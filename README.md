Tic-Tac-Toe Built Using the Ruby Programming Language
========
What is Necessary to Play:
--------
+ You will need Ruby installed. For Mac Users, I highly recommend [RVM](https://rvm.io/)
+ Open up your Mac OS X Terminal. This can be found by hitting command + space at the same time. Type in 'terminal' and it will appear in the list. Click to open.
+ Once your terminal is open, copy and paste the below line to install RVM
	\curl -L https://get.rvm.io | bash -s stable --rails --autolibs=enabled # Or, --ruby=1.9.3

Open up your terminal and type in 'git clone https://github.com/DavidPardy/ttt_v2.git'

- Once that process has taken place, type in 'cd ttt_v2', then 'cd lib'.

- To run the game, type in 'ruby start_game.rb'. This should bring up the board and ask for human input.

- The game is currently set up as human versus computer. The human is represented by an 'X' on the board, while the computer is shown as a 'O' on the board.
